    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>I am Josh Williams. I grew up in Kent, Washington. I studided music and guitar at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and I received bachelor's and master's degrees in jazz performance. I worked as a showband guitarist and music manager on Carnival Cruise Line for six years after I graduated. I moved back to the Seattle area in 2018, and I have been teaching music and performing locally ever since. My short term goal is to complete Code Fellows and become a hirable programmer so I can start a more stable career. Sometime down the line, I would like to find a way to merge my skills in music and programming to work with a company such as <a href="https://www.makemusic.com/"; target="_blank">Make Music</a> or <a href="https://www.pgmusic.com/"; target="_blank">PG Music</a>.</p>
